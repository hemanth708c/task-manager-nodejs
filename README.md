# Task Manager App 🧠

A simple and clean **Task Manager** built using **Node.js** and **vanilla JavaScript**.  
This project helped me practice building a full-stack app from scratch — frontend, backend, and local storage — without using any frameworks.

## Features
- Add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete  
- Set due dates and organize tasks by category  
- Switch between dark and light mode  
- Sort, filter, and search tasks easily  
- Data is saved locally (no database needed)

## Tech Stack
**Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
**Backend:** Node.js + Express  
**Storage:** JSON file for persistence
